Welcome to OpenSquare.io, it's an off-chain voting solution for projects in polkadot ecosystem.

## What is Off Chain Voting
With off chain voting, you sign your vote with polkadot extension, and we will store it to IPFS. Not any transactions to chain, no gas consumption.

##  Benefits of Off Chain Voting
- No gas consumption, which we expect to increase token holders' engagement.
- Not only for governance, it works well for informal polls and suggestion collection. 
- Data uploaded to IPFS, not fully decentralized but verifiable.

## Supported projects
- Relay chain: [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Kusama](https://kusama.network/).
- Para chains: [Karura](https://acala.network/karura), [Khala](https://phala.network/en/khala) currently, while we will add most of the Kusama para-chains soon.
- Assets issued on [Statemine](https://statemine.statescan.io/) / Statemint: in our plan, will be available in the future.
