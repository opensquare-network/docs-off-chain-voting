## Definition of Space
A space is a place for one project to do off-chain voting. Currently, the spaces is predefined, 
but projects will be able to create space for themselves soon. We will support:
- Relay chains: Kusama, Polkadot.
- Para chains: like Karura, Khala, etc.
- Statemine/Statemint assets: like RMRK, etc.

For para-chains who want to be onboard quickly, [contact Us](mailto:yongfeng@opensquare.network).
