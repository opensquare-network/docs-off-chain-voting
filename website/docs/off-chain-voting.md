Off chain voting refers to governance systems where individual votes are not submitted as blockchain transactions. No transaction fees are necessary for off chain votes.

##  Benefits of Off Chain Voting
- No transaction fees required to vote
- More participation, particularly from smaller holders and wider community
- Off chain votes can be recorded via decentralized data storage systems, reducing risk of vote tampering
- Works well for sentiment polls or other low risk votes

## Is Off Chain Voting secured
In token weighted voting schemes, users are prompted to sign messages with their wallet to vote, and the resulting data is stored via a decentralized file storage system such as IPFS.
This storage mechanism significantly reduces risk of vote tampering, meanwhile, OpenSquare enacts the results on chain using admin privileges.
